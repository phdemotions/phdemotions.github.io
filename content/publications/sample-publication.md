abstract: "This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 87 studies examining how discrete emotions influence consumer brand evaluations. Results indicate that specific emotions have distinct effects on brand trust, purchase intentions, and willingness to pay, even after controlling for overall affective valence. We identify moderators of these effects and discuss implications for theory and practice."
