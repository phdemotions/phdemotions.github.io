Welcome to the first issue of my newsletter! I'm excited to share insights from my research on consumer psychology and help you understand the fascinating ways our emotions shape our choices.

## This Week's Insight: Emotional Shopping Triggers

Have you ever bought something you didn't plan to purchase, only to realize later you were feeling stressed, excited, or lonely? You're not alone. My research shows that specific emotional states create predictable shopping patterns.

### The Three Most Common Emotional Shopping Triggers

1. **Stress Shopping**: When anxious or overwhelmed, we often seek small purchases that give us a sense of control
2. **Celebration Buying**: Positive events trigger reward-seeking behavior
3. **Loneliness Purchases**: Social disconnection often leads to buying products that promise connection or self-improvement

### What You Can Do

The key isn't to suppress emotions or avoid shopping—it's awareness. Try this simple practice:

- Before making a non-essential purchase, pause and ask: "What am I feeling right now?"
- Wait 24 hours for purchases over $50
- Keep a simple log: What did you buy, and how were you feeling?

You'll start to notice patterns. And awareness is the first step to more intentional decisions.

## Recent Research Highlight

A new study in the *Journal of Consumer Research* found that people who identify their emotional state before shopping report 30% higher satisfaction with their purchases a week later. It's not about buying less—it's about buying more intentionally.

## Coming Next Issue

I'll dive into how different emotions (not just positive vs. negative) influence what types of products we're drawn to. Spoiler: Anger and fear lead to very different shopping behaviors!
