## Overview

My dissertation research examines the role of discrete emotions in shaping consumer brand perceptions and purchase intentions. While previous research has established that emotions influence consumer behavior, much of this work has focused on broad affective states (positive vs. negative mood) rather than specific emotional experiences.

## Research Questions

1. How do different discrete emotions (e.g., joy, fear, anger, sadness) differentially influence brand perceptions?
2. What mechanisms mediate the relationship between emotional states and purchase intentions?
3. How do these effects vary across different product categories and consumer segments?

## Methodology

This research employs a multi-method approach:

- **Experimental Studies**: Controlled experiments manipulating emotional states and measuring brand evaluations
- **Survey Research**: Large-scale surveys examining naturally occurring emotional experiences
- **Physiological Measures**: Eye-tracking and biometric data to complement self-report measures

## Current Status

Currently in the data collection phase for Study 2 of 4. Preliminary findings from Study 1 suggest that discrete emotions have distinct effects on brand trust and purchase likelihood, even when controlling for overall emotional valence.

## Implications

This research has implications for:

- **Marketing Strategy**: Understanding how to align brand communications with consumer emotional states
- **Consumer Welfare**: Helping consumers make better decisions by understanding emotional influences
- **Theoretical Advancement**: Refining models of consumer decision-making to incorporate emotional complexity

## Timeline

- **Study 1** (Completed): Fall 2024
- **Study 2** (In Progress): Winter 2025
- **Study 3** (Planned): Spring 2025
- **Study 4** (Planned): Fall 2025
- **Expected Completion**: Spring 2026

## Publications & Presentations

Preliminary findings from this research have been presented at:

- Consumer Psychology Conference 2024
- Society for Consumer Psychology Annual Meeting 2024

A manuscript based on Study 1 is currently under review at the *Journal of Consumer Research*.
