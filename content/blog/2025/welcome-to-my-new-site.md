Welcome to my newly redesigned website! I'm excited to have a dedicated space to share my research, writing, and insights on consumer psychology, behavioral economics, and the fascinating ways our minds shape our decisions.

## What You'll Find Here

This site serves several purposes:

### Research & Publications

As a PhD candidate at the University of Guelph, I study consumer psychology with a focus on emotions and decision-making. You can find my [academic publications](/publications/) here, along with links to my work on Google Scholar.

### Blog & Writing

I write regularly about consumer behavior, psychology, and research insights. My articles have appeared in outlets like **The Conversation** and **Psychology Today**, and I'll be sharing both original content and cross-posts from those platforms here.

### Projects

I'm involved in various [research projects](/projects/) exploring how emotions influence consumer decisions. I'll be documenting these projects and sharing updates as they develop.

## Why This Matters

Understanding consumer psychology isn't just academic—it has real-world implications for how we make choices, how businesses communicate with customers, and how we can become more aware of the factors influencing our decisions.

> "The best way to predict the future is to understand how people make decisions in the present."

## What's Next

I'll be regularly publishing new content here, including:

- Research insights and findings
- Commentary on consumer behavior trends
- Deep dives into psychological concepts
- Updates from my dissertation research

If you'd like to stay updated, consider [subscribing to my newsletter](/newsletter/)—I share insights, research updates, and thoughtful essays on consumer psychology and decision-making.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, journalists, and anyone curious about consumer psychology. Feel free to reach out via the contact information on my [about page](/about/).

Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you.
