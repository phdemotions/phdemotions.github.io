# About Josh Gonzales

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Guelph, where I study consumer psychology with a focus on entertainment and morality. 

As a writer, I translate academic research into accessible insights for broader audiences. My work has been featured on **Psychology Today** and (soon) in **The Conversation**, where I write about consumer behavior and the psychology behind everyday decisions.

Beyond academia, I'm also a musician, which informs my understanding of how emotional experiences shape our perceptions and choices.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on research examining the use of AI in arts creation and consumer purchase intention. My dissertation focuses on variety-seeking and specialization in hobbies.

## Academic Background

- **PhD in Service Management (Consumer Psychology)** - University of Guelph (In Progress)
- **M.A. in Experimental and Applied Psychology** - University of Regina

## Writing & Media

I regularly write for general audiences about psychology and consumer behavior. My articles have reached thousands of readers through platforms like The Conversation and Psychology Today.

For media inquiries, speaking opportunities, or collaboration requests, please contact me via email.
