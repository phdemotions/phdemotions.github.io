# About Josh Gonzales

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Guelph, where I study consumer psychology with a focus on how emotions influence decision-making and behavior. My research explores the intersection of psychology, marketing, and human behavior.

As a writer, I translate academic research into accessible insights for broader audiences. My work has been featured in **The Conversation** and **Psychology Today**, where I write about consumer behavior, emotions, and the psychology behind everyday decisions.

Beyond academia, I'm also a musician, which informs my understanding of how emotional experiences shape our perceptions and choices.

## Research Interests

- **Consumer Emotions & Decision-Making**: How emotional states influence purchasing behavior and brand relationships
- **Behavioral Economics**: The psychological factors that drive economic decision-making
- **Marketing Psychology**: The intersection of cognitive science and consumer behavior
- **Emotional Regulation**: How people manage emotions in consumption contexts

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on research examining emotional responses to marketing communications and how different emotional states affect consumer decision-making processes. My dissertation focuses on the role of discrete emotions in shaping brand perceptions and purchase intentions.
